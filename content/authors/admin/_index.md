Teal Emery is an independent research analyst who uses modern data science tools to uncover actionable insights relevant to policymaking, financial markets, and business.  

He worked for seven years as an emerging markets investment research analyst for Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM). He traveled regularly to Africa, the Middle East, and across the developing world to meet with economic policymakers, business people, and civil society. He has a strong interest in sustainability issues and created MSIM's first sovereign ESG framework.  

Over time, he increasingly used a data science approach (using R and Python) to economic and financial analysis.  In 2020 he left Morgan Stanley and began working as a consultant to the World Bank on analysis and thought leadership related to aligning sovereign debt investing with sustainability goals. Currently he is working to expand his data science toolkit and build up his private sector consulting practice.
