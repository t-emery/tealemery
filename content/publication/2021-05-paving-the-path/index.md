abstract: Climate risks are on the rise globally. For emerging market countries such as Chile, these risks can manifest as an increased propensity for drought, wildfires, flood events, and landslides. As a result, governments are increasingly prioritizing policy solutions that will support an economic transition to mitigate the impact of climate change while also supporting households and communities as they adapt to the changing risk landscape. The financial sector is playing a key role in supporting a just economic transition. For many emerging market countries, the sovereign is the largest issuer of domestic debt, and the instruments and issuance path they choose can be key toward influencing downstream financial sector activity. For their part, global investors are becoming more attuned to the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that underpin sovereign debt instruments. This report explores Chile’s sovereign issuer options, opportunities, and challenges through the lens of its recent decisions to issue green, social, and sustainable debt instruments.

summary: How can sovereign debt issuers manage rising climate risks, and finance the investments necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the SDGs? As part of a team including former Chilean minister of finance, Felipe Larraín, we documented Chile's experience re-orienting its sovereign debt issuance to be better aligned with fulfilling its ambitious sustainability goals.
