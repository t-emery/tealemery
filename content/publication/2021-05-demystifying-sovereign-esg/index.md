abstract: The evolution of sustainable finance to mainstream finance has been
  motivated by a growing demand for the financial sector to play a greater role
  in the transformation of the current economic model into a more sustainable
  one. The introduction of the United Nationâ€™s (UN) Sustainable Development
  Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015 have helped galvanize
  a societal shift to ensure a sustainable future and to fight climate change in
  particular. As a result, the pace of environmental, social, and governance
  (ESG) integration, which has become the most prevalent form of sustainable
  finance, has accelerated in recent years. Market participants continue to
  grapple with adapting the ESG framework to the sovereign context, despite
  significant progress of ESG integration in the corporate bond and equity asset
  class. This challenge is due to the multifaceted nature of ESG-related issues
  facing governments in relation to corporate entities, as well as a more
  complex transmission mechanism of the sovereign debt asset class to
  sustainable outcomes in the real economy. This paper demystifies sovereign ESG
  as a distinct segment of the ESG sector by assessing the major sovereign ESG
  providers that have laid the foundation for the operationalization of ESG
  investing in sovereign fixed income markets.

summary: As ESG investing has progressed from its origins in equity markets to sovereign fixed income markets, what exactly does "Sovereign ESG performance" measure?  We find that Sovereign ESG scores are highly correlated with a country's level of income.  This *ingrained income bias* has the potential to skew capital flows towards rich countries and away from developing nations, exacerbating SDG funding gaps, and incentiving investment in countries with higher per-capita CO2 emissions.
